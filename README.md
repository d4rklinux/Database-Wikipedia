# Database-Wikipedia

Database project for the Federico II University of Naples

Description:
This database project was created by three students from the University of Naples Federico II. The goal is to create a database called "Wikipedia" that allows the management of users and authors. Authors can create, edit and delete pages, as well as approve changes proposed by users, providing them with feedback. Users, however, can view the pages, carry out searches and propose changes, which will be implemented only if approved by the authors.

The project includes several key files:

    dump_Wikipedia.sql: Creates the entire database.
    popolamentoDb.sql: populates the database with initial data.
    TabelleWikipedia.sql: Creates the tables described in the class diagram.
    funzioniETrigger.sql: contains the functions and triggers necessary for the operation of the database, managing the insertion, modification and deletion of text, as well as the registration of users and authors.

This project represents an example of how to structure a complex database, implementing advanced features for collaborative content management.
